# k8s-resources (sandbox branch)

This branch is used for hands-on practice with Kubernetes YAML files.

---

## ⚙️ Purpose

The `sandbox` branch is where I:

- Practice Kubernetes concepts repeatedly  
- Create, modify, and delete files freely  
- Reinforce learning through regular experimentation  

---

## 📁 Usage

- This branch will have frequent changes.  
- Files may be incomplete, temporary, or experimental.  
- It supports my learning by providing a space to explore freely without restrictions.

---

## 📎 Note

This branch is only for personal practice and learning.  
Refer to the `main` branch for clean, tested, and organized YAML files.
