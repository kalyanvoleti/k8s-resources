# 📁 k8s-resources (Sandbox Branch)

This branch is used for **hands-on practice and experimentation with Kubernetes YAML manifests**.  
The `sandbox` branch allows you to explore ideas freely, create, modify, and test manifests without affecting the stable versions in the main branch.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The `sandbox` branch serves as a workspace to:

- Reinforce Kubernetes concepts through repeated practice.  
- Experiment with Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Deployments, StatefulSets, and DaemonSets.  
- Test new ideas, configurations, or patterns before finalizing them in the main branch.

---

## 📁 Usage

- Files in this branch are **frequently updated**.  
- Some manifests may be **incomplete or experimental**.  
- This branch is intended solely as a **learning and testing environment**.

---

## 📎 Note

Refer to the `main` branch for **stable, finalized, and portfolio-ready manifests**.  
The `sandbox` branch exists to **support ongoing experimentation and skill development**.
